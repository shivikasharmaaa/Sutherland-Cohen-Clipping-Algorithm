# Sutherland-Cohen-Clipping-Algorithm
Illustrating the Sutherland-Cohen 2D Line Clipping Algorithm, used in computer graphics to save time and reduce overhead by only rendering portions of lines contained in the viewing region of a window.
##
The following video demonstrates the line clipping algorithm on user-specified window dimensions and line segments through an interactive program using OpenGL API.
